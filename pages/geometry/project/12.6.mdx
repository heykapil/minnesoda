The dual to Pappus' theorem is itself.

From the textbook:
If A, C, E are three points on one line, B, D, F on another, and if
the three lines AB, CD, EF meet DE, FA, BC respectively at points L,
M, N, then L, M, N are collinear.

The dual, swappings points and lines:

In the following declaration, let AB denote the point of intersection
of lines A and B.

If A, C, E are three lines that meet at a point P, and B, D, F a
different set of three lines that meet at a point Q, and if the three
points AB, CD, EF join to DE, FA, BC respectively forming lines L, M,
N, then L, M, N meet at one point R.
