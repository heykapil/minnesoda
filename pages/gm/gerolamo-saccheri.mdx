Came up with three hypotheses:

1. HRA (Hypothesis of the Right Angle.) The summit angles are right angles. (∠C = ∠D = 90◦.)
2. HAA (Hypothesis of the Acute Angle.) The summit angles are acute angles. (∠C = ∠D < 90◦.)
3. HOA (Hypothesis of the Obtuse Angle.) The summit angles are obtuse angles. (∠C = ∠D > 90◦.)
