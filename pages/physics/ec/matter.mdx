Structure of Matter
===================

Matter is made of atoms

|          | charge    | mass               |
| -------- | --------- | ------------------ |
| proton   | positive  | 1.673 \* 10^-27 kg |
| neutron  | no charge | 1.675 \* 10^-27 kg |
| electron | negative  | 9.109 \* 10^-31 kg |

The charge of 1 electron and 1 proton are of equal magnitude

Net charge of an atom is zero.

If electrons are removed from an atom, it gains a positive charge and
is called a positive ion
