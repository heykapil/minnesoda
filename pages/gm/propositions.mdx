_Proposition I.16_. In any triangle, if any one of the sides is
produced, the exterior angle is greater than either of the interior
and opposite angles.

Proposition I.16 was then used to prove:

_Proposition I.17_. In any triangle, two angles taken together in any
manner are less than two right angles.

_Proposition I.27_. If a straight line falling on two straight lines
makes the alternate angles equal to one another, then the straight
lines are parallel to one another.
