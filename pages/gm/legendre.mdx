A.M. Legendre
=============

Theorem. (Legendre) The sum of the three angles of a triangle is less
than or equal to 180°

Proof. Let `A_1A_2C_1` be a triangle. Along the line `A_1A_2`
(assuming it can be extended indefinitely), place the triangles
`A_2A_3C_2`, ..., `A_nA_{n+1}C_n`, each congruent to `A_1A_2C_1` next
to each other.

Suppose `180° < 𝛼 + 𝛽 + 𝛾` (negates the Theorem above).

Note the location of angle `𝛿`. Since `180° = 𝛼 + 𝛽 + 𝛿`, then `𝛿 <
𝛾`.

Now look closely at almost-parallelogram `A_1A_2C_2C_1`. Since `𝛿 <
𝛾`, then `C_1C_2 < A_1A_2`. Iterating, we have

```
C_1C_2 + C_2C_3 + \ldots + C_{n-1}C_n <
A_1A_2 + A_2A_3 + \ldots + A_{n-1}A_n
```

Let `C_iC_{i+1} = p` for all `i ∈ \{1,2,\ldots, n - 1\}`. Then let `d
= c - p > 0`.

The total length `A_1C_1 + C_1C_2 + C_2C_3 + \ldots + C_{n-1}C_n +
C_nA_{n+1}` is `b + (n-1)p + a`.

By triangle inequality, it is greater than or equal to `A_1A_{n+1} =
nc`.

Thus:

```
\begin{align*}
b + (n - 1)p + a &\geq nc \\
\Rightarrow b - p + a &\geq n(c - p) = nd
\end{align*}
```

Since LHS is a constant, by taking a sufficiently large `n`, we have a
contradiction. (Here we applied the Archimedean Property of real
numbers)
