# Gauss Law

Gauss Law states that the total electric flux through any closed surface is proportional to the
net electric charge inside the surface.

```
\Phi_E = \df{q}{\epsilon_0}
```

If the surface is irregular, we have to do a closed integration:

```
\ointi{E_\perp}{A} = \df{Q_\text{encl}}{\epsilon_0}
```
