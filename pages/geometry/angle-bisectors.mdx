Angle Bisectors
===============

The internal bisectors of the 3 angles of $\tri{ABC}$ are concurrent.
Their common point is called the **incentre** of $\tri{ABC}$.

The incentre is equidistant to the sides of the triangle, and the
circle centered at it is called the **incircle**.

That circle's radius is the **inradius**.

Let $s = \tf{1}{2}(a + b + c)$ be the semi-perimeter. We have

1. $x = s-a,\ y = s-b,\ z = s-c$
2. $(ABC) = sr$
3. $abc = 4srR$
