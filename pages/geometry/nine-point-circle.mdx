# Nine point circle

The feet of the three altitudes of any triangle, the midpoints of the
three sides, and the midpoints of the segments from the three
vertices to the orthocentre, all lie on the same circle of radius
$\f{1}{2}R$ with $\f{1}{2}R$ centre at the midpoint of the Euler line. This is the
nine-point circle or the Euler circle of the triangle.
