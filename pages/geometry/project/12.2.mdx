Let four points $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$ be collinear, and in that
particular order. Note that this means $AC$ separates $BD$.

Then let the cross ratio $\newcommand\cr[1]{\langle{#1}\rangle}
\cr{A,B,C,D} = \lambda$. In particular,

$$
\f{AC \cdot BD}{AD \cdot BC} = \lambda
$$

There are a total of $4!$ ways to permutate four points, but observe
that

$$
\cr{A,B,C,D} = \f{AC \cdot BD}{AD \cdot BC} = \cr{B,A,D,C} 
$$

hence swapping points pair-wise doesn't change the cross ratio, and

$$
\cr{A,B,C,D}
= \f{AC \cdot BD}{AD \cdot BC}
= \f{CA \cdot DB}{CB \cdot DA}
= \cr{C,D,A,B}
$$

hence swapping the pairs doesn't change the cross ratio.

So that means we have a family of cross ratios that are equal:

$$
\cr{A,B,C,D}
= \cr{B,A,D,C}
= \cr{C,D,A,B}
= \cr{D,C,B,A}
$$

This narrows our search of unique cross ratio values to just $4! \div
4 = 6$.

Now, let variable points $P$, $Q$, $R$, $S$ be new points that take
different permutations of the positions of $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$.

For conciseness, let $(P,Q,R,S)$ denote that $P$ is placed at $A$, $Q$
is placed at $B$, $R$ is placed at $C$, and $S$ is placed at $D$.

Case 1: $(P,Q,R,S)$

This is the original case, so
$$
\cr{P,Q,R,S} = \cr{A,B,C,D} = \lambda
$$

---

Case 2: $(Q, P, R, S)$
$$
\cr{P,Q,R,S}
= \f{PR\cdot QS}{PS\cdot QR}
= \f{BC\cdot AD}{BD\cdot AC}
= \f{1}{\lambda}
$$

Note that this case also equals $\cr{B,A,C,D} = \cr{A,B,D,C}$.

---

Case 3: $(P,S,Q,R)$

$$
\cr{P,Q,R,S}
= \f{PR\cdot QS}{PS\cdot QR}
= \f{AD\cdot CB}{AB\cdot CD}
= \lr{\f{AB\cdot CD}{AD\cdot CB}}^{-1}
= \f{1}{1-\lambda}
$$

Note that this case also equals $\cr{A,C,D,B}$.

---

Case 4: $(P,R,Q,S)$
$$
\cr{P,Q,R,S}
= \f{PR\cdot QS}{PS\cdot QR}
= \f{AB\cdot CD}{AD\cdot CB}
= \cr{A,C,B,D}
$$

Consider the ratio of $\cr{A,C,B,D}$ and $\cr{A,D,B,C}$:
$$
\begin{align}
\cr{A,C,B,D} \div \cr{A,D,B,C}
\end{align}
$$

---

Case 5: $(P,R,S,Q)$

$$
\cr{P,Q,R,S}
= \f{PR\cdot QS}{PS\cdot QR}
= \f{AB\cdot DC}{AC\cdot DB}
= \cr{A,D,B,C}
$$

With reference to case 2, and since $AC$ separates $BD$,
$$
\cr{A,D,B,C}
= 1 - \cr{A,B,D,C}
= 1 - \f{1}{\lambda} = \f{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}
$$
