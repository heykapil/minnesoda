A.M. Legendre
=============

Theorem. (Legendre) The sum of the three angles of a triangle is less
than or equal to 180°

Proof. Let `A_1A_2C_1` be a triangle. Along the line `A_1A_2`
(assuming it can be extended indefinitely), place the triangles
`A_2A_3C_2`, ..., `A_nA_{n+1}C_n`, each congruent to `A_1A_2C_1` next
to each other.

Suppose `180° < 𝛼 + 𝛽 + 𝛾` (negates the Theorem above).

Note the location of angle `𝛿`. Since `180° = 𝛼 + 𝛽 + 𝛿`, then `𝛿 <
𝛾`.

Now look closely at almost-parallelogram `A_1A_2C_2C_1`. Since `𝛿 <
𝛾`, then `C_1C_2 < A_1A_2`. Iterating, we have

```
C_1C_2 + C_2C_3 + \ldots + C_{n-1}C_n <
A_1A_2 + A_2A_3 + \ldots + A_{n-1}A_n
```

With a difference big enough such that

```
A_1C_1 + (C_1C_2 + C_2C_3 + \ldots + C_n) + C_nA_{n+1} <
(A_1A_2 + A_2A_3 + \ldots + A_n) + A_{n+1}
```

Implying that the shortest distance between `A_1` and `A_{n+1}` is not
a straight line, leading to a contradiction.
