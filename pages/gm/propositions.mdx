_Proposition I.16_. In any triangle, if any one of the sides is
produced, the exterior angle is greater than either of the interior
and opposite angles.

Proposition I.16 was then used to prove:

_Proposition I.17_. In any triangle, two angles taken together in any
manner are less than two right angles.

_Proposition I.27_. If a straight line falling on two straight lines
makes the alternate angles equal to one another, then the straight
lines are parallel to one another.

Euclid did not make use of Postulate 5 until Proposition I.29:

_Propostion I.29_. A straight line falling on parallel straight lines
makes the alternate angles equal to one another.

_Propostion I.32_. The exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the
sum of the two interior and opposite angles; the sum of the interior
angles of a triangle is `180Â°`.
