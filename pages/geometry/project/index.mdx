## Things that don't make sense in projective geometry

These are theorems that do not hold true across all projections. In
each of the theorems covered, I will be providing an example of a case
where the theorem doesn't hold after a projection, followed by a
commentary on its applicability in affine geometry.

1. [Varignon's Theorem](#varignon's-theorem)
2. [Steiner-Lehmus Theorem](#steiner-lehmus-theorem)

### Varignon's Theorem

![varignon](/geometry/varignon.png)

Let the blue points and lines denote a picture of Varignon's Theorem
on the plane $z = 1$, and let the orange points and lines be their
projection onto the plane $x + z = \tf{3}{2}$.

With this projection we can observe two things:
1. **Collinearity is preserved.** If three points are collinear before
   the projection, then they will remain collinear after the
   projection.
2. **Midpoints are not preserved.** Consider side $RS$ and its
   midpoint $C$. After the projection, it's clear that $C'$ is no
   longer the midpoint of $R'S'$.
3. **Parallel lines are not preserved.** Before the projection,
   $AB\parallel CD$, but $A'B' \not\parallel
   C'D'$.

In affine geometry, all three mentioned parameters are preserved.
Hence, under all affine transformations, parallelogram $ABCD$ should
always be mapped to a new parallelogram $A'B'C'D'$.

Since midpoints are preserved, $A'$ should remain the midpoint of $P'$
and $Q'$, as with the other three sets of points. So the original four
points in general position $P$, $Q$, $R$, and $S$ will be mapped to a
new four points in general position where their midpoints still
correspond.

Since the picture remains valid and the parallelogram is still
present, Varignon's Theorem holds in affine geometry.

### Steiner-Lehmus Theorem

![menelaus](/geometry/steiner-lehmus.png)

Again, let the blue features be a picture of the Steiner-Lehmus
theorem on the $z = 1$ plane, and let the orange features be that
picture projected onto the $x+y+z=2$ plane.

With this projection, we can observe two additional properties of
projection:
1. **angles are not preserved.** E lies inside of AB but E' lies
   outside of A'B'. So $\a{ACB} > \a{ECB}$ (2 times, to be exact,
   since the blue picture is a construction of the Steiner-Lehmus
   theorem.) but $\a{A'C'B'} < \a{E'C'B'}$. So clearly at least one of
   the angles changed after the projection.
2. **ratios of non-collinear lengths are not preserved.** $AB = AC$
   but $A'B' \neq A'C'$.

With these properties of projection, isoceles triangles and angle
bisectors are not preserved either. Hence the Steiner-Lehmus theorem
doesn't hold after a projection.

This theorem doesn't hold in affine geometry because affine
transformations do not preserve angles. (take for example the skew
transformation)

### Menelaus' theorem

![menelaus](/geometry/menelaus.svg)

The theorem in states that

$$
\f{AD}{DB}\cdot
\f{BE}{EC}\cdot
\f{CF}{FA} = -1
$$

However, in Euclidean space this requires $DE$ to be anything but
parallel to $AC$, else they don't meet, by the Fifth Postulate, and
the last point $F$ doesn't exist.

If this triangle is set in projective space, we can say that point $F$
exists at infinity, where

$$
\lim\limits_{F\to\infty} \f{CF}{FA} = -1
$$

And since we have $DE\parallel AC,$ by Thales' theorem on intercepts,
we have

$$
\f{AD}{DB} = \f{CE}{EB}
$$

from which we can easily show that

$$
\f{AD}{DB} = \lr{\f{BE}{EC}}^{-1}
$$

With these results, Menelaus' theorem holds true again.
