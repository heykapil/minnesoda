Postulates (Axioms)

1. To draw a straight line from any point to any point.
2. To produce a finite straight line continuously in a straight line.
3. To describe a circle with any centre and distance.
4. That all right angles are equal to one another.
5. <span id="fifth-postulate" />
   That, if a straight line falling on two straight lines makes the
   interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the
   two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on
   which are the angles less than the two right angles.
