Structure of Matter
===================

Matter is made of atoms

|          | charge    | mass               |
| -------- | --------- | ------------------ |
| proton   | positive  | 1.673 \* 10^-27 kg |
| neutron  | no charge | 1.675 \* 10^-27 kg |
| electron | negative  | 9.109 \* 10^-31 kg |

The charge of 1 electron and 1 proton are of equal magnitude

Net charge of an atom is zero.

If electrons are removed from an atom, it gains a positive charge and
is called a positive ion.

Principle of Conservation of Charge
===================================

Sum of all the electric charges in any closed system is always
constant.

Charge is never created or destroyed; it is only transferred.

The magnitude of a charge of the electron or the proton is a natural
unit of charge.

Every observable charge is an integral multiple of this basic unit
quantization of charge.

Conductors, Insulators, Induced Charges
=======================================

Conductors permit easy movement of electric charge through them
(metals).

Insulators do not permit electric charge to move easily through them
(rubber, nylon).

Methods of charging a conductor

1. By transferring charge:
   - Touch an uncharged conductor with a charged conductor, then
     separate the two; they will now repel.
2. By induction:
   - Move a charged conductor close to an uncharged conductor, then
     ground the uncharged conductor; they will now attract.

Earth is a huge conductor.

Induced charge effect
---------------------

i.e. polarization

A charged object can attract uncharged objects by reorienting modules
such that the unlike charges are closer.
