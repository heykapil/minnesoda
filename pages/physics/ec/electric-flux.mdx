Electric Flux
=============

Consider a flat area `A` that is at an angle `\phi` from being
perpendicular to a uniform electric field `E`.

The electric flux `\Phi_E` through this area is given by:

```
\begin{align}
\Phi_E
&= EA_\perp \\
&= EA \cos\phi \\
&= E_\perp A \\
\end{align}
```

If `A` is not flat, we need to integrate.

```
\Phi_E = \inti{E\cos\phi}{A}
```
