The dual to Pappus' theorem is itself.

Pappus' theorem states that: If $A$, $B$, $C$ are three points on one
line, $a$, $b$, $c$ on another, and if the three lines $Ab$, $Bc$,
$Ca$ meet $Ba$, $Cb$, $Ac$ respectively at points $X$, $Y$, $Z$, then
$X$, $Y$, $Z$ are collinear.

The dual:

In the following declaration, let $AB$ denote the point of
intersection of lines $A$ and $B$.

If $A'$, $B'$, $C'$ are three lines that meet at a point $P'$, and $a'$,
$b'$, $c'$ a different set of three lines that meet at a point $p'$, and
if the three points $A'b'$, $B'c'$, $C'a'$ join to $B'a'$, $C'b'$, $C'a'$
respectively forming lines $X'$, $Y'$, $Z'$, then $X'$, $Y'$, $Z'$ meet at
one point $R'$.

In the first declaration of Pappus' theorem, take note of two
particular lines:
1. the line on which $A$, $B$, $C$ lie on. Let this line be $A'$.
   Observe that $A'$ also has three named points in the dual
   statement: $P'$, $A'c'$, $A'b'$
2. the line on which $a$, $b$, $c$ lie on. Let this line be $a'$.
   Observe that $a'$ similarly has three named points in the dual
   statement: $Q'$, $B'a'$, $C'a'$.

So taking the following mapping: $A \to P'$, $B \to A'c'$, $C \to
A'b'$, $a \to Q'$, $b \to B'a'$, $c \to C'a'$, it can be seen that the
two dual statements are making the same claim.

Hence, the dual of Pappus' theorem is itself.

We will proceed to prove Pappus' theorem, using definitions from the
first declaration.

Let $U$ lie on the intersection of $Ba$ and $Cb$, $V$ lie on the
intersection of $Ba$ and $Ac$, and $W$ lie on the intersection of $Ac$
and $Cb$.

Then, apply Menelaus' theorem on each of
$\tri{UVW}\newcommand\menelaus[3]{\f{U#1}{#1V}\cdot\f{V#2}{#2W}\cdot\f{W#3}{#3U}
= -1}$'s five traversal lines:

1. traversal $Ab$:
$$
\menelaus{X}{A}{b}
$$
2. traversal $Ca$:
$$
\menelaus{a}{Y}{C}
$$
3. traversal $Bc$:
$$
\menelaus{B}{c}{Z}
$$
4. traversal $AC$:
$$
\menelaus{B}{A}{C}
$$
5. traversal $ac$:
$$
\menelaus{a}{c}{b}
$$

By taking the products of cases 1-3 divided by the products of cases 4
and 5, we can show that

$$
\menelaus{X}{Y}{Z}
$$

Hence $X$, $Y$, $Z$ are collinear and thus proves Pappus' theorem.
