Conductors, Insulators, Induced Charges
=======================================

Conductors permit easy movement of electric charge through them
(metals).

Insulators do not permit electric charge to move easily through them
(rubber, nylon).

Methods of charging a conductor

1. By transferring charge:
   - Touch an uncharged conductor with a charged conductor, then
     separate the two; they will now repel.
2. By induction:
   - Move a charged conductor close to an uncharged conductor, then
     ground the uncharged conductor; they will now attract.

Earth is a huge conductor.

Induced charge effect
---------------------

i.e. polarization

A charged object can attract uncharged objects by reorienting modules
such that the unlike charges are closer.
