Gerolamo Saccheri
=================

tl;dr:

Came up with three hypotheses:

1. HRA (Hypothesis of the Right Angle)
2. HAA (Hypothesis of the Acute Angle)
3. HOA (Hypothesis of the Obtuse Angle)

HRA is logically equivalent to Postulate 5.

HOA successfully reached a contradiction.

But Saccheri found HAA to be inconclusive.
