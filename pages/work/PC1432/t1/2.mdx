Consider the force along the y-direction:

For every positive charge contributing a downward vector, there is an
equal and opposite negative charge reflected about the y-axis
contributing and equal and opposite upward vector. Hence the electric
field has a net y-component of zero.

Let us consider the x-component.

Let a small section of the curve on the negative side be `\d Q`.
Let the angle that it, the centre, and the positive x-axis forms be
`\theta`.

Then the electric field along the x-component caused by each small
section is

```
\d E = \df{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \df{\d Q}{a^2} \cos\theta
```

Since a total charge of `Q` is spread across a quarter circle, we have

```
\begin{align*}
\df{\d Q}{\d \theta}
&= \df{Q}{\left(\f{\pi}{2}\right)} \\
&= \df{2Q}{\pi}
\end{align*}
```

Substituting this into the equation for `\d E`, we have

```
\d E = \df{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \df{2Q}{\pi a^2} \cos\theta\;\d\theta
```

To obtain the net electric field caused by the left half, we
integrate:

```
\begin{align}
E
&= \intd{0}{\f{\pi}{2}}{\df{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\df{2Q}{\pi a^2}\cos\theta}{\theta} \\
&= \df{Q}{2\pi^2 \epsilon_0 a^2}\intd{0}{\f{\pi}{2}}{\cos\theta}{\theta} \\
&= \df{Q}{2\pi^2 \epsilon_0 a^2} \\
\end{align}
```

Similarly, the net electric field caused by the right half will have
the same magnitude, but be in the opposite direction.

So the net electric field at the origin produced by the entire
semi-circle distribution of change is

```
E_\text{net} = \df{Q}{2\pi^2 \epsilon_0 a^2} \\
```

in the positive x-direction.
