Electric force between two charges: Coulomb's Law
=================================================

The magnitude of electric force between two point charges is directly
proportional to the product of the charges and is inversely
proportional to the square of the distance between them

```
F = K \df{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2}
```

where `K = \df{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}` is Coulomb's constant.

```
\begin{align}
K &= 8.987 \times 10^{-9} \units{C^{-2}Nm^2} \\
\epsilon_0 &= 8.854 \times 10^{-12} \units{C^2N^{-1}m^{-2}}
\end{align}
```

SI unit of charge is Coulomb (`\mathrm{C}`)

Charge of electron = `1.602 \times 10^{-19} \units{C}` (elementary charge)

Principle of superposition of forces
------------------------------------

tldr: to get net force of multiple charges, apply Coulomb's Law with
vector sum.
