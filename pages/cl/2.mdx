# Limits and Continuity

<t id="easy-limits"/>Easy limits: those that can be directly plugged in.

```
\lim_{x\to 2} x + 3 = 5
```

Derivatives are always harder.

```
\lim_{x\to x_0}\df
{f(x_0 + \Delta x) - f(x_0)}
{x - x_0}
```

At the limit, `x = x_0` causes a division by zero, so this always
requires cancellation.

## Left/right-hand limits

Right-hand limit: `\lim_{x\to x_0^-}`, that is when `x` approaches
`x_0` from the right, where `x > x_0`.

Left-hand limit: `\lim_{x\to x_0^+}`, that is when `x` approaches
`x_0` from the left, where `x < x_0`.

# Continuity

`f` is continuous at `x_0` is defined as

```
\lim_{x\to x_0} f(x) = f(x_0)
```

Subtleties:
1. `\lim_{x\to x_0}` exists.
    * `\lim_{x\to x_0^+}` and `\lim_{x\to x_0^-}` both exist, and are
      equal.
2. `f(x_0)` is defined.

These kinds call under the "easy" limits.

## Jump Discontinuity

Limit from left and right exist but are not equal.

## Removable Discontinuity

Limit from left and right are equal, but there is a removable
discontinuity.

Try plotting `y = \df{\sin x}{x}`. The graph will appear smooth but
it's undefined at `x = 0`. We say that there is a removable
discontinuity at `x = 0`.
