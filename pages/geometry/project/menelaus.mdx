# Menelaus' theorem

![menelaus](/geometry/menelaus.svg)

The theorem in states that

$$
\f{AD}{DB}\cdot
\f{BE}{EC}\cdot
\f{CF}{FA} = -1
$$

However, in Euclidean space this requires $DE$ to be anything but
parallel to $AC$, else they don't meet, by the Fifth Postulate, and
the last point $F$ doesn't exist.

If this triangle is set in projective space, we can say that point $F$
exists at infinity, where

$$
\lim\limits_{F\to\infty} \f{CF}{FA} = -1
$$

And since we have $DE\parallel AC,$ by Thales' theorem on intercepts,
we have

$$
\f{AD}{DB} = \f{CE}{EB}
$$

from which we can easily show that

$$
\f{AD}{DB} = \lr{\f{BE}{EC}}^{-1}
$$

With these results, Menelaus' theorem holds true again.
