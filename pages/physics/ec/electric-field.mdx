Electric field
==============

The electric field `E` at any point is defined as the force `F`
experienced by a test charge `q` place at that point, divided by its
charge.

```
E = \df{F_0}{q_0}
```

SI unit of electric field is `\mathrm{NC^{-1}}`.

Relation: charge \* electric field = force on charge

```
qE = F
```
