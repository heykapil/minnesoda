Principle of Conservation of Charge
===================================

Sum of all the electric charges in any closed system is always
constant.

Charge is never created or destroyed; it is only transferred.

The magnitude of a charge of the electron or the proton is a natural
unit of charge.

Every observable charge is an integral multiple of this basic unit
quantization of charge.
