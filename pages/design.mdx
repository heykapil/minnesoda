Design Philosophy
=================

## Front-end

Function before form: functionality pushed to the point where it
breeds its own aesthetic.

No rounded corners.

No fades (no drop shadows, no gradients), solid colors only.

One font thoughout (excluding MathJax).

Minimal colorscheme: [blue]() for links and `\text{pink}` for math.

## Back-end

Minimize package use.

Never add files to root folder.

Maintain three absolutely necessary root folders:

* /pages -> academic stuff only (plus necessary files \_app.js and 404.js)
* /src -> components and styles
* /public -> images
