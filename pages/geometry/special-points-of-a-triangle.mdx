## Perpendicular bisectors

The three perpendicular bisectors to the sides of a triangle $ABC$
meet at a common point $O$, the circumcentre of the triangle. The
point $O$ is equidistant to the three vertices of the triangle.

Thus the circle centred at $O$ with radius $OA$ passes through the
three vertices of the triangle. This circle is called the
**circumcircle** of the triangle and its radius $R$ is called the
**circumradius** of the triangle.
