Design Philosophy
=================

Function before form: functionality pushed to the point where it
breeds its own aesthetic.

No rounded corners.

No fades (no drop shadows, no gradients), solid colors only.

One font thoughout (excluding MathJax).

Minimal colorscheme: [blue]() for links and `\text{pink}` for math.
